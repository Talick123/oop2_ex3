General Description of the Assignment:
    In this assignment we were asked to implement exceptions on a programable 
    calculator for sets. The calculator starts with 3 basic operations on sets; Union,
    Intersection and Difference. The user may use the program to calculate
    different operations on sets from the list of operations as well as add new
    operations using the available commands.


    //Tali: the only file we added is Exceptions.h, other than that all is the same
    //Noga: I think we need to write THEIR readme - they have different classes
Design:
    Classes: SetCalculator, Operation, CompOperation, Union, Intersection, Difference,
    Product, Composite, Sets, Identity

    Calculator:
        - responsible for dealing with input of commands and holding/executing
         all the available operations
    Operation:
        - base class for CompOperation and Identity
    CompOperation:
        - base class for all basic operations, deals with compound operations
        created using one of the basic operations (union, intersection etc)
    Identity:
        - class that acts as the "leaf" of our binary search tree, returns
        the set needed in the calculation of the operation calling it
        - inherits from Operation
    Union, Intersection, Difference, Product, Composite:
        - all are classes that inherit from CompOperation and take the outcomes
        of the 2 Operations received and executes on them the required operation
    Sets:
        - class that deals with the data structure that is the sets received and
        printed, makes sure to remove multiple occurrences of digits as well as
        sorts the set

    Overall: The Operation class acts as a root of the binary search tree built
    from compound operations that then branch off eventually to basic operations
    and then identity. It is built in a way such that a pass on the tree "in order"
    produces that required operation.

Files:
    - Calculator.h/Calculator.cpp: contains class Calculator
    - Set.h/Set.cpp: contains class Set
    - Operation.h/Opertation.cpp: contains base class Operation
    - CompOperation.h/CompOperation.cpp: contains class CompOperation
    - Union.h/Union.cpp: contains class Union
    - Difference.h/Difference.cpp: contains class Difference
    - Intersection.h/Intersection.cpp: contains class Intersection
    - Product.h/Product.cpp: contains class Product (multiplies the sets)
    - Composite.h/Composite.cpp: contains class Composite
    - utilities.h: contains constant variables
    - PrintUtilities.h/PrintUtilities.cpp: contains function to print colored text

Main Data Structures and their Jobs:
    - vector of shared_ptr of class Operations that contains all the operations
    in the calculator available for the user
    - binary search tree described in the Design above
    - all other main data structures and their jobs: see Design above


Notable Algorithms:
    - the following algorithms were used from the <algorithm> library:
        - std::ranges::set_union
        - std::ranges::set_intersection
        - std::ranges::set_difference
        - std::ranges::unique
        - std::ranges::sort
    - access to the data in the binary search tree of operations is done in order

Known Bugs:
    - no known bugs

Other General Notes:
    - no other notes




 Things to be mentioned:

 - printing of letters as representations of sets in operations list is completed
    in a cyclical way
- if the user encounters an exception while reading from a file, if the user says
    they no longer want to continue then the program will return to the basic
    set calculator we began with (not reading from file)
- all commands are written in the same line as the values of the operations
- after the eval command, the sets required will be represented all in the
    following line
- the program will read a line in its entirety, if within the line not all arguments
    are present, the program will let the user know and request the user to input again
    (if in file, will ask if user wants to continue reading)
